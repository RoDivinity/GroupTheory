# GroupTheory
Implementations of group theory 

  * Check digits
   1) UPC scheme
      => Implement the use of weight on position of digit. 
      
      => Create an injective function from serial code to check digit.
      
      => The weight is alternative
       
       |==Can the weight be 3 repeating? i.e (1,2,3,1,2,3,...)?
       
       |==Can the weight is different from sequence (3,1,3,1,3,1 ... )?
      
      E Version: abbreviated serial number (Only 8 digit)
      
      => 4 step functions for distributed weight of digit to make an injective function
   2) 
   
   
  * Test for prime
  * RSA encryption
